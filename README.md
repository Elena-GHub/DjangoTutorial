# DjangoTutorial
Repo where I will be uploading the files as I follow the official Django tutorial.  
[Writing your first app (Polls)](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/)

### My initial setup:
* Django 3.1.2
* Python 3.9
* IDE: VS Code
  
### Secret key exposed warning  
I received a notification about the secret key from this django project being exposed. Although this is not code for production whatsoever, I looked into it and I decided to set it as an env variable. Besides the [official django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/deployment/checklist/) I found a clear [video tip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IolxqkL7cD8) by Corey Schafer, right to the point.
